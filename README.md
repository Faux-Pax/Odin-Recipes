# Odin-Recipes
I think I am doing this right. I am attempting to show my HTML skills from what I learned in The Odin Project before I start I would like to document What I am feeling.
Ever had this feeling when you climb on top of a diving board on a swimming pool and when you reach towards the end you feel like your feet are locked but you can't turn back because someone is waiting on you so the only the choice you have is jump.
That is what I'm going to do make a leap of faith (:
